When user exits out of game, when a win/lose screen is displayed, the screen flashes back to the main gameplay display before closing.


Potential Implementations:

Difficulty buttons

Score counter in main display

Ability to replay without having to exit out of game and run code again

Limited flag counter, only (number of targets) flags allowed

Sound when clicking on mines, placing flags, removing flags etc.

If user left clicks on tile when it has a flag over it, remove the flag on the first click before allowing the user to left click the tile to reveal what is underneath
