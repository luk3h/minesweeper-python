Bugs:

Can instantly win game by marking any square, as the score increases when the user presses right click, not when a target is correctly marked.

When user exits out of game, when a win/lose screen is displayed, the screen flashes back to the main gameplay display before closing.


Potential Implementations:

Difficulty buttons

Score counter in main display

Ability to replay without having to exit out of game and run code again

Limited flag counter, only (number of targets) flags allowed

Sound when clicking on mines, placing flags, removing flags etc.
